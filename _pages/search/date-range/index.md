The Date Range Filter allows user to filter assets by date. There are two methods for date filtering: Date Range and Relative Date Range.

### Date Range

The asset's date must fall between the user-selected start and end dates (the dates are evaluated at 12:00AM of the selected day).

* If no end date is specified, the asset's date must occur after the start date.
* If no start date is specified, the asset's date must occur before the end date.

### Relative Date Range 

The asset's date be within the user-selected relative date range. See Authoring > Relative Date range below for details.

This filter leverages AEM Query Builder's [DateRangePredicateEvaluator](https://docs.adobe.com/content/docs/en/aem/6-3/develop/ref/javadoc/com/day/cq/search/eval/DateRangePredicateEvaluator.html) and
[RelativeDateRangePredicateEvaluator](https://docs.adobe.com/content/docs/en/aem/6-3/develop/ref/javadoc/com/day/cq/search/eval/RelativeDateRangePredicateEvaluator.html) predicate evaluators.
